HOW TO USE THE DATA WITH ARCEXPLORER
1. Download the data from the FEMA web site and save it to a 
temporary directory on your hard drive (e.g. c:\temp\mm_dfgi.zip or 
d:\temp\mm_dfgi.zip).  
2. Follow the instructions from the ESRI web site to download 
and install the ArcExplorer software (Note: ArcExplorer is free 
mapping software that can be downloaded from the Internet at 
http://www.esri.com/ and follow the link to "Free Resources.").  
Start ArcExplorer by either double clicking the shortcut icon 
on your desktop or by finding it under the "Start" menu under 
"Programs".  This should start ArcExplorer for you and display 
a screen that says, "Welcome to ArcExplorer" with a "tip of the 
day."  Click "OK" to remove the "tip of the day" screen and 
begin using ArcExplorer.
3. Use the Windows Explorer to navigate to the subdirectory 
where you placed your downloaded file (e.g. c:\temp).  Drag 
the downloaded file (mm_dfgi.zip) from Windows Explorer over to the 
white map pane in ArcExplorer and drop the file there.
4. ArcExplorer will bring up the "Select folder to extract to..." 
window.  Click on the Create Folder button and make a new 
directory on your hard disk to store the prototype (e.g. 
C:\FEMAPROT).  Then click on the Open button to extract the 
data from the zip file into the new directory you created.
5. The map themes should display under the "Local" tab and in 
the map window.  You can use the tools on the toolbar to pan, 
zoom, identify map features, and query the data.  See the user 
documentation that comes with ArcExplorer for more 
information.
