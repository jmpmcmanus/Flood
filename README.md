# Flood Relief Through Mapping

## Background
Hurricane Florence was powerful and caused severe and extensive damage in the Carolinas in September 2018, primarily as a result of freshwater flooding.
## Goal
We aim to construct a map integrates information on flooding, vulnerability and demographic data. This map hopefully will help relief organization prioritize the order in which they help people, enabling them to focus on the neediest first. Over a longer period, the maps will help household apply for grants and funding, per status of vulnerability.
## Result
We built this prototype map of Cumberland County in North Carolina, using GeoPandas, and open data from USACE Analysis Flood Maps, CDC, FEMA Insurance Map, and NC One Map Census Tracts in State Plane link.
## Further Scope
The long-term goal is to make an interactive online map which is not only spacial scalable but also scalable to integrate different hazard types. Further function would include applying machine learning to automatically recognize the area of flood or other types of hazard by satellite images.
